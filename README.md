## Notes

I used MUI to build the interface. I kept it pretty basic.

I was going to implement react-query, but since I opted for an optimistic UI approach to my data handling, I decided not to, since it would take more time than I should probably spend on this. React Query allows for optimistic UI, but its a bit more integrated.

I used Vite to build this app. Vite is made by Vercel. It's a better alternative to create-react-app (feel free to ask me about this).

The app is built with Typescript. 

I implemented an ESLint config I share with one of my coding colleagues that we use in our personal apps. Was easier to set up than setting up ESLint from scratch.
